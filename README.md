# noname-china-ap-cam-receiver

Simple GUI application to receive MJPEG streams from the noname AP camera.
The app allows configuring connection parameters and manipulating the video in
real time. It supports recording, snapshots and basic image transformations.
Open the settings dialog via the **Settings** menu to adjust connection
options. Changes are persisted to `config.json`.
The preview canvas keeps a 1:1 aspect ratio and shows a message if the stream
is not running.
Run with:
```bash
python main.py
```
